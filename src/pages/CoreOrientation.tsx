            Your interpretation of the world was shaped over time by your life experiences. This unique interpretation

          <p>To keep you safe, the brain scans for patterns that signal danger.</p>
          <p>
            Traumatic or repeated stressful experiences can program your system to be on constant alert searching for
            recognized patterns to shield you in the future. Over time, these patterns become physical structures in the
            brain and strongholds in our lives.{" "}

            Coping mechanisms, limiting beliefs, emotional walls, and even physical symptoms are survival strategies
            that the body erects in an effort to ensure your survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            But learned prediction patterns are not permanent. With reassuring repetition, the brain can update
            expectations and safety can be restored.
          </p>
          <p>
            This process is known as neuroplasticity, and when we align our thoughts with Truth, the renewing of the
            mind touches all areas of our lives.
